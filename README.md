Concept:
Our prison is a unique facility located on Morocco's ocean shore. It houses prisoners from across the country who have shown good behaviour in previous prisons. The prison focuses on rehabilitation and correction in a smart and sustainable environment based on a rewarding system.
the project implements the domotics to facilitate the many aspects of the jail, such as creating adaptable (IR) openings (out/in-doors), controlled mechanisms at all once, and well-organized environments where shifts are well organized and sustainability actions take place.

our team is 6 people from different backgrounds two from each department:
- 2 SAP+D: School of  Architecture, Planning & Design
- 2 SHBM: School of Hospitality Business & Management
- me and my friend from LEET: 1337 Coding School.

the tasks that I implemented with my friend are:
- create a web interface to help staff of prison to manage daily tasks like (manage present of the staff, food cost control by Menu choice, Prisoner's profiles &archive history, facilitating an award system andorganizational structure), and Access control the all from the app. (like: controle opening/close doors, controle the elevator, lighting, )
- design a system to manage and secure the prison.
- programe the system in the arduino
